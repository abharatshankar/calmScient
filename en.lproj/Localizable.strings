Half of liver disease deaths in the United States are caused by alcohol, and alcohol-associated liver disease is increasing, particularly among women and young people.

Research has shown an important association between alcohol consumption and breast cancer—for each 10 grams of alcohol consumed (less than 1 standard drink) on an average daily basis, a woman’s chance of developing postmenopausal breast cancer increases by around 9 percent.

Research has also shown that alcohol misuse increases the risk of liver disease, cardiovascular  diseases, depression, and stomach bleeding, as well as cancers of the oral cavity, esophagus, larynx, pharynx, liver, colon, and rectum.

People who misuse alcohol may also have problems managing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, pain, and sleep disorders.
 
And people who misuse alcohol are more likely to engage in unsafe sexual behavior, putting themselves and others at risk for sexually transmitted infections and unintentional pregnancies.

Birth defects. Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in brain damage and other serious problems in babies. The effects are known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, or FASD, and can result in lifelong physical, cognitive, and behavioral problems.

Signs of AUD may also include drinking to alleviate negative emotions such as feeling ”low” anxious, uneasy, unhappy, unwell, dissatisfied with life, or other negative emotions that were caused or worsened by alcohol misuse.
 
 Beyond these physical and mental health risks, frequent alcohol misuse also is linked with personal problems, such as losing one’s driver’s license or having relationship troubles.";

Often these individuals are unaware that their body’s lower response to the intoxicating effects of alcohol isn’t protection from alcohol problems but instead is a reason for caution.

These individual tend to drink more, socialize with people who drink a lot, and develop a tolerance to alcohol(i.e., it takes more and more alcohol to feel or act intoxicated). As a result , they have an increased risk for developing AUD. Someone who misuses alcohol, especially over the long=term, can experience permanent liver, heart, or brain damage. And all people who drink, regardless of thr amount, need to be aware that critical decision-making abilities and driving-related skills are already diminished long before a person shows physical signs of intoxication.";
